# DDNet
### *A Double-feature ðŸš€ Double-motion ðŸš€ Network*

This is an unofficial Tensorflow implementation of the [DDNet â€“ Double-feature Double-motion Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09658.pdf)

The authors of this repository believe, that this implementation is more readable and easier to understand than [the original one.](https://github.com/fandulu/DD-Net)

## Usage

This repository contains sources directory with implementation.

`sources/DDNet.py` - contains the actual model class

`sources/create_dataset.py` - script for creating a binary files with skeletons and labels (with pickle) from a
dataset that has a structure like [SHREC](http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/shrec2017-hand/). Note that you may need to
modify it if the structure of your dataset is different.

`souces/utils.py` - contains an important Config class with configurations for model training. There are also all
utilisation functions for the model training.

`sources/train.py` - script for training a model on a preprocessed dataset like
[SHREC](http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/shrec2017-hand/). Note that can modify this script to work with your own 
dataset.
